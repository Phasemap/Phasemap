## 🔬Phasemap Algorithms

Phasemap is built on a series of modular AI routines that analyze blockchain market dynamics, trend behavior, and structural volatility in real time.

### 1. 🌀 PhaseMap — Cycle Transition Detector  
**Language:** Python

```python
def phase_map(market_data):
    phase_threshold = 0.1
    price_change = (market_data["current_price"] - market_data["previous_price"]) / market_data["previous_price"]
    volume_change = (market_data["current_volume"] - market_data["previous_volume"]) / market_data["previous_volume"]

    if abs(price_change) > phase_threshold or abs(volume_change) > phase_threshold:
        return "Alert: Market Phase Transition Detected"
    else:
        return "Market Phase Stable"
```
#### AI Logic: Detects phase shifts (e.g., accumulation → breakout) by monitoring price and volume deltas.

### 2. 📈 GrowthShift — Trend Momentum Forecaster

```python
def growth_shift(market_data):
    price_growth = (market_data["current_price"] - market_data["previous_price"]) / market_data["previous_price"]
    depth_factor = market_data["total_volume"] / market_data["market_liquidity"]
    
    prediction_score = price_growth * depth_factor

    if prediction_score > 0.1:
        return "Alert: Market Growth Predicted"
    else:
        return "Market Stable"
```
#### AI Logic: Combines price momentum and liquidity depth to forecast directional trends.

### 3. 🌊 DataWave — Real-Time Volatility Scanner

```javascript
function dataWave(marketData) {
  const volatilityIndex = marketData.priceChange / marketData.previousPrice;
  const liquidityRisk = marketData.totalVolume / marketData.marketLiquidity;

  const marketRisk = volatilityIndex * liquidityRisk;

  if (marketRisk > 0.5) {
    return 'Alert: High Market Volatility Detected';
  } else {
    return 'Market Volatility Low';
  }
}
```
#### AI Logic: Detects market turbulence using live price swings and liquidity behavior.

### 4. 🔍 MarketLens — Phase Visual Interpreter

```python
def market_lens(market_data):
    price_change_pct = (market_data["current_price"] - market_data["previous_price"]) / market_data["previous_price"]
    volatility_impact = market_data["price_fluctuation"] / market_data["volume"]

    if price_change_pct > 0.2 and volatility_impact > 0.3:
        return "Alert: Market Growth Phase Detected"
    elif price_change_pct < -0.2 and volatility_impact > 0.3:
        return "Alert: Market Decline Phase Detected"
    else:
        return "Market in Neutral Phase"
```
#### AI Logic: Maps current market mood based on directional shifts and volatility strength.

### 5. 🛡 TrendGuard — Market Risk Detector

```python
def trend_guard(market_data):
    trend_score = (market_data["current_price"] - market_data["previous_price"]) / market_data["previous_price"]
    volume_score = market_data["volume"] / market_data["previous_volume"]

    risk_score = abs(trend_score) * volume_score

    if risk_score > 0.15:
        return "Alert: High Market Risk Detected"
    else:
        return "Market Trend Stable"
```
#### AI Logic: Flags risky momentum by analyzing rapid price movement combined with abnormal volume behavior.
